But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn\u2019t popular. \n\nAs part of his PD class, he had to create a children\u2019s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He\u2019d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation.\n\nBut I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he\u2019s never received before. As he\u2019d refused to participate in class and didn\u2019t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset.\n\nI asked him what happened and why he didn\u2019t do the presentation. He said he didn\u2019t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it now,\u201d but didn\u2019t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3.\n\nI kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t go down\u201d.\n\nWith that info, I think George\u2019s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn\u2019t refuse to do the presentation\u2014he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him.\n\nHis mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn\u2019t think George was wrong. I said I\u2019m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, \u201cWhy did he even have one in class to begin with?\u201d I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don\u2019t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true,\u201d dismissing what I said. So I told her, \u201cYou might not be sure, but I am.\u201d\n\nShe insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven\u2019t had in years. \n\nShe\u2019s saying she is going to punish him for refusing when it\u2019s her week with him next week and that I am being an AH for \u201cgoing against her\u201d. Her mother text me saying I was setting a bad example for George by letting him get away with being disrespectful to his teacher. Which he wasn\u2019t even, just asked to do his presentation later. I respectfully told her she should mind her own business, and that George was my son. \n\nBut now I\u2019m worrying whether I\u2019ve done the right thing, and I need some outside perspectives. ",

We did a whole 2 days in primary school dedicated to sex Ed, just before we turned 10-11(?ish) and went on to secondary school.

I was young so didn't know how to articulate it, but I knew there was something wrong with what they were telling us and it made me extremely uncomfortable. But I didn't know how much was me knowing they were wrong or the fact that I was born four months after my parents' wedding. As an adult I know exactly how gross that was, and wish I could go back and tell them how horrible they were and how much damage their \"education\" did to those girls. Over half of them got pregnant before 20, and even more than that were married super young.",

I was young so didn&amp;#39;t know how to articulate it, but I knew there was something wrong with what they were telling us and it made me extremely uncomfortable. But I didn&amp;#39;t know how much was me knowing they were wrong or the fact that I was born four months after my parents&amp;#39; wedding. As an adult I know exactly how gross that was, and wish I could go back and tell them how horrible they were and how much damage their &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; did to those girls. Over half of them got pregnant before 20, and even more than that were married super young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That said though, a boner will go away on its own and honestly might go down out of sheer embarrassment of having to do the presentation. The kid likely could have given the presentation about five minutes later and been fine if the teacher had let him.   If a girl has her period and doesn't want to get up in front of the class that means that bodily fluid has actively leaked through her clothing, possibly onto her seat, and that's not going to be fixed until she gets cleaned up and a fresh pair of clothing.   These are bad things to compare because one situation will eventually handle itself and the other will continue to get worse until it is handled and requires extra steps to take care off.   A better comparison would be the girl who doesn't want to go up because its a bit cold in here and she can cut diamonds with her boobs as a result.

Let THEM educate her on the fact that boys can get random errections during puberty, I mean even adults can get them without the sexual aspect being involved. I mean 'morning wood's a prime example. You're asleep and still manage to get one. But for young boys, they can experience unexpected errections without any sexual component causing them. She needs to hear this from a professional because right now she is dead set against anything you say being true. She won't believe anything you try and tell her. You could try finding educational videos on YouTube that talk about it which 'may' help her understand,but if she refuses to agree that she was wrong,and continues to have the mindset that your son was somehow 'wrong' or 'perverted in some way for getting an errection in class, then she needs to be taught about how male bodies work and puberty and the things that can happen from a medical professional. I'd like to hope she wouldn't be so stubborn as to hold her ground against medical professional. \n\nAlso she needs to think about what she's teaching your son if she chooses to go ahead and disapline him. He wasn't refusing to do his presentation, he just asked to do it a bit later after a couple of others do theirs first to give himself time to hopefully let the situation settle. So he wasn't being bad or misbehaving or being disrespectful or refusing to do it. So what is she going to be punishing him for?? What will she tell him he's done wrong?? Any way she tries to frame it, she's disaplining him for having an errection basically. She can say it's because he refused to do the presentation when asked, but would she honestly want him to stand up infront of his classmates with an errection to get laughed at and further bullied? Would she prefer that to him asking politely to do it a little bit later? \nBecause essentially the only message she will be sending her son is that he was wrong for getting an errection. That the errection was bad and dirty and shameful and wrong. That he's shameful for getting an errection in class. That he's fundamentally wrong and bad and dirty for the errection. (That was totally out of his control and not from anything sexual). She will give him a very negative and shameful view of sex and sexual pleasure as he develops. It could even cause him to feel ashamed every time he gets an errection, to be fearful and anxious and then cause him further problems of feeling ashamed and embarrassed when he gets to an age of being in a sexual relationship. He will likely feel shameful regarding masterbation and see it as wrong and dirty. All these issues can stem from how she makes him feel regarding an innocent reaction that caused an errection which is a natural part of puberty. But how she treats him, and punishes him for it could have long term effects for how he views things in future. \n\nYour son is likely completely embarrassed enough having to tell you, but atleast you were supportive and understanding and reassuring etc, but he's likely feeling embarrassed to know that his mum knows, and now his teachers will know too because of having to explain the situation plus his grandmothers been told too etc. He's already going through a tough time, and instead of being understanding and supportive and having his back, and reassuring him it's normal and OK and nothing to be ashamed of, she's doing the opposite and making him feel ashamed and wrong. There was no need for MIL to be told his business. \n\nPlease also show her this post and all the comments. Hopefully that will possibly shame her into admitting she was wrong and she will see how she's failing her own son. Because she should be ashamed of herself. She needs to do better. And she needs to seriously apologise to him and make him believe that it's ok and normal and nothing to be ashamed of. She needs to educate herself and accept she was wrong. And even admit that to her son. And your MIL needs to appologise to you too. And stay out of your business. \n\nYou keep reassuring your son, and letting him know it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of. You need to counter all the negative your wife is doing. \n\nAnd I hope she can see she was wrong and admit it and appologise. But if showing her this thread doesn't work, or you tube education videos,then take her to the GP so they can explain it to her.\n\nEdit to say, in hindsight, going to the drs is probably a waste if a drs apt, or nurse apt, but definitely Google it and find some YouTube education videos for her to see that it's normal etc.",

However, I would have probably followed up with the parent to see if they had any insight. Or, if I didn't, I can say that I would be very responsive to the parent reaching out and explaining.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't think anyone necessarily did anything wrong here, it's just a tricky situation (especially for a teenager) and dad calmly reaching out and explaining the situation is probably the best solution.\u00a0\n\n\nBUT, I would not suggest just ignoring the punishment or storming in guns blazing. Being pissed is fine, and following up is great, but if OP goes in raging at the teacher and demanding the detention be removed he's going to satisfy his own sense of righteousness, but do a lot of a damage to his relationship with his son's school.\u00a0",

However, I would have probably followed up with the parent to see if they had any insight. Or, if I didn&amp;#39;t, I can say that I would be very responsive to the parent reaching out and explaining.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone necessarily did anything wrong here, it&amp;#39;s just a tricky situation (especially for a teenager) and dad calmly reaching out and explaining the situation is probably the best solution.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, I would not suggest just ignoring the punishment or storming in guns blazing. Being pissed is fine, and following up is great, but if OP goes in raging at the teacher and demanding the detention be removed he&amp;#39;s going to satisfy his own sense of righteousness, but do a lot of a damage to his relationship with his son&amp;#39;s school.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy son \u201cGeorge\u201d just turned 13 this month. \n\nGeorge is very bright, projected to get 8s or 9s in his GCSEs, and regularly achieves these grades in his mock exams and assessments. But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn\u2019t popular. \n\nAs part of his PD class, he had to create a children\u2019s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He\u2019d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation.\n\nBut I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he\u2019s never received before. As he\u2019d refused to participate in class and didn\u2019t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset.\n\nI asked him what happened and why he didn\u2019t do the presentation. He said he didn\u2019t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it now,\u201d but didn\u2019t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3.\n\nI kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t go down\u201d.\n\nWith that info, I think George\u2019s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn\u2019t refuse to do the presentation\u2014he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him.\n\nHis mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn\u2019t think George was wrong. I said I\u2019m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, \u201cWhy did he even have one in class to begin with?\u201d I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don\u2019t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true,\u201d dismissing what I said. So I told her, \u201cYou might not be sure, but I am.\u201d\n\nShe insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven\u2019t had in years. \n\nShe\u2019s saying she is going to punish him for refusing when it\u2019s her week with him next week and that I am being an AH for \u201cgoing against her\u201d. Her mother text me saying I was setting a bad example for George by letting him get away with being disrespectful to his teacher. Which he wasn\u2019t even, just asked to do his presentation later. I respectfully told her she should mind her own business, and that George was my son. \n\nBut now I\u2019m worrying whether I\u2019ve done the right thing, and I need some outside perspectives. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
